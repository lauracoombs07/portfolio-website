            <p id="family">The most important thing in my life, is my family. I have an incredible, supportive husband,
                Ben, and five amazing kids. Cameron, Sawyer, Kylie, Grayson, and Alexia. They are my world.
                I'll be completely honest, I am not an animal lover, but my children are. That makes our pets an important
                part of our family. We have two dogs, Oki and Korra and a Turtle named Bubbles.

                            Ben and I have been married for 16 and a half years. We met working at a
                            Youth Treatment Center in 2005. We had decided when we had our first child, Cameron,
                            that one of us would always be home with the kids. <br>
                            <br>
                            Five years ago, I told Ben that I wanted to go back to work. He was completely
                            supportive. We made the adjustments required, and I started working full time.
                            Since that day, Ben has done everything in his power to make sure that I can be successful
                            in my career. He is my biggest cheerleader and my best friend. I am so grateful for him.

                        Cameron is our oldest child. He is 15 years old and is in 9th grade. He loves technology and
                        is always trying to figure out how things work. He is a great big brother and is always willing
                        to help out with his younger siblings. He is a great kid and I am so proud of him. <br>
                        Lately, we have been working on his driving skills. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when he
                        grew up! He is also working at a local restaurant, Smoke and Bones. He loves it and is saving
                        up for a car of his own.

                    Sawyer is my second child. He is 13 years old and is in 7th grade. He dreams of being an entrepreneur
                    and is always coming up with new business ideas. He is a great big brother and is always willing to help
                    out with his younger siblings. He is a great kid and I am so proud of him. <br>

                    My creative child, Kylie is 11 years old and is in 6th grade. She is a natural artist and loves to
                    draw and paint. Any kind of craft or art project is right up her alley and she is always willing to
                    try something new. Lately, she has been really into baking; which is a hobby we all love to eat!

                    Grayson loves sports. He is naturally athletic and loves to play soccer, basketball, and football.
                    His favorite, however, is soccer and he spends long hours practicing. He loves math and is one of
                    the fastest learners I have ever met.

                    I have ever seen before. She creates worlds and stories in her head and is always willing to share them.
                    She collects stuffed animals and loves them all equally. She treats them as if they are alive and has
                    wonderful adventures every single day.
