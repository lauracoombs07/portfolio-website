            <h3>Family</h3>
            <p>The most important thing in my life, is my family. I have an incredible, supportive husband,
                Ben, and five amazing kids. Cameron, Sawyer, Kylie, Grayson, and Alexia. They are my world.
                I'll be completely honest, I am not an animal lover, but my children are. That makes our pets an important
                part of our family. We have two dogs, Oki and Korra and a Turtle named Bubbles.

                            Ben and I have been married for 16 and a half years. We met working at a
                            Youth Treatment Center in 2005. We had decided when we had our first child, Cameron,
                            that one of us would always be home with the kids. <br>
                            <br>
                            Five years ago, I told Ben that I wanted to go back to work. He was completely
                            supportive. We made the adjustments required, and I started working full time.
                            Since that day, Ben has done everything in his power to make sure that I can be successful
                            in my career. He is my biggest cheerleader and my best friend. I am so grateful for him.

                        Cameron is our oldest child. He is 15 years old and is in 9th grade. He loves technology and
                        is always trying to figure out how things work. He is a great big brother and is always willing
                        to help out with his younger siblings. He is a great kid and I am so proud of him. <br>
                        Lately, we have been working on his driving skills. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when he
                        grew up! He is also working at a local restaurant, Smoke and Bones. He loves it and is saving
                        up for a car of his own.
