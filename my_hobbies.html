                        <p>Over the last year, I have discovered the joys of digital art.
                            I have never been what anyone would consider an artist. I don't have the
                            patience or the creativity. But I have found that digital art is a completely
                            different experience. It is especially fun to create digital art with my kids.
                            My daughter Kylie is a natural artist, and she has been teaching me how to use my
                            ipad to create art. I have found that I really enjoy it! Here are a couple of my most
                            recent creations.

                    <p>I have always loved writing. While I have never been interested
                    in making it my profession, I absolutely love writing as a hobby.
                    Children's books in particular interest me. Recently, I had the
                    opportunity to write a book for my nephew. He was in the hospital
                    after a terrible fall, and I wanted to create something that would
                    help him remember some of the more positive aspects of his traumatic
                    event.</p>

                    <p>
                        I have always loved baking. I have been baking since I was a teenager. Many people believe that
                        baking and cooking are the same thing, but they are not! I cannot cook to save my life. Baking, however,
                        comes far more naturally to me. I love the precision of baking. I love that I can follow a recipe and
                        create something delicious. I love that I can share my creations with my family and friends. I love that
                        I can create something that brings joy to others. My 3 favorite things to bake are Pies, Breads and
                        Cinnamon Rolls.
